# About
Hi, my name is Isaac Kargar and I am the CIO and co-founder of [SUPPLYZ](https://www.supplyz.eu/). In addition to my professional endeavors, I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Intelligent Robotics Group at Aalto University in Finland. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, going on walks, reading, listening to podcasts and music.
